# Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.

## Usage

- [link to posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#linking-to-posts)
There is no need to include the file extension when using the post_url tag.
You can also use this tag to create a link to a post in Markdown as follows:
```
[Name of Link]({% post_url 2010-07-21-name-of-post %})
```
