I have just [reimplemented][sdust] the [symmetric DUST algorithm][paper]
(SDUST) for masking low-complexity regions. The program depends on [kdq.h][kdq]
(double-ended queue) and [kvec.h][kvec] (simple vector); the command line
interface further requires [kseq.h][kseq] for FASTA/Q parsing. As I have tried
on human chr11, the output is identical to the output by [NCBI's
dustmasker][dm] except at assembly gaps. The speed is four times as fast.
I have also compared this implementation to [mdust][mdust], which is supposed
to be a reimplementation of the original asymmetric DUST. The mdust result
under the same score threshold seems to differ significantly from
SDUST/dustmasker. I haven't looked into the cause.

I understand the basis of the SDUST algorithm, which is quite elegant, but I
haven't fully understood all the implementation details. I was just literally
translating the pseudocode in the paper to C, with occassional reference to the
[dustmasker source code][dmsc]. If you have any problems, please let me know.
