## methods

Sequencing reads were processed using singleron-RD/scrna v1.1.0(https://github.com/singleron-RD/scrna), utilising reproducible software environments from the Bioconda (Gr√ºning et al., 2018) and Biocontainers (da Veiga Leprevost et al., 2017) projects. Briefly, STARsolo (v.2.7.11b) were used with default parameters, except that the FDR in the --emptypdrops_CR parameter was changed from the default 0.01 to 0.001.
